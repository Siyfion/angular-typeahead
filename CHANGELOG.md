# CHANGELOG

## v1.0.0 - Major refactoring

The code has been rewritten almost from scratch with a focus on code quality and testing. This will make future development easier and limit the number of bugs on the long term. Beware that regressions are likely!

- Built files are now wrapped in [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd)
- Add unit tests, jshint and continuous integration
- Moved built files to `dist/` folder
- Values set directly to $scope.model are no longer validated against the suggestions.
- Remove ambiguous "suggestionKey" parameter
- moved options not related to tt to top level
- renamed "editable" option to "allow-custom"

## v0.3.2
* Adds render event

## v0.3.1
* Removed the "all-events" binding, as the code didn't work.

## v0.3.0
* Fixes \#71, \#72 and \#79, binds ALL typeahead events adds `require()` support.

## v0.2.4
* Adds typeahead.js v0.11.1 dependency

## v0.2.3
* Adds async event propagation (Thanks @powange)
* Fixes the Firefox "focus bug" (Thanks @CyborgMaster)

## v0.2.2
* Adds a watcher to the datsets and options and reinitializes if any changes are detected.

## v0.2.1
* Removes the event bindings as they should no-longer be needed due to the new way the ng-model is being updated.

## v0.2.0
* This is a *potentially* **BREAKING CHANGE** release.
* This adds initial support for two-way data binding.

## v0.1.4
* Adds a sanity check to the options object for the 'editable' property.

## v0.1.3
* Adds 'editable' option, to only allow model values from datum objects. (Thanks to @raphahardt)

## v0.1.2
* Retains cursor position, thanks to @skakri.

## v0.1.1
* Adds event propagation for all the other typeahead.js events.

## v0.1.0
* This is a **BREAKING CHANGE** release.
* Major new release that adds initial support for the new Twitter Typeahead v0.10.x release.
* As a direct result of Twitter's changes, two-way binding is no longer possible at this time (the directive cannot access any local datum lists & never could access remote lists).
* You can now update local datasets using [`Bloodhound#add`](https://github.com/twitter/typeahead.js/blob/master/src/bloodhound/bloodhound.js#L151) and I have questioned whether a similar method could be added for datum removal.

## v0.0.12
* Merged in Jakob Lahmer's changes, which ensures that the typeahead events are propagated to the scope.

## v0.0.11
* Merged in slobo's changes, including a refactoring of the event methods and a slight hack around the [object Object] issue.

## v0.0.10
* Reverting previous change in v0.0.9 (return the datum object, not the string!)

## v0.0.9
* Added type check to the datum object, in-case the datum is a string that is implicitly converted.

## v0.0.8
* Bugfix for issue #10
* The fix should also support datums with non-default value keys.

## v0.0.7
* Now updates the ngModel with the raw user input.
* Optimization on the ngModel watch.

## v0.0.6
* Merged in @jmaynier's PR for supporting multiple datasets. (Thanks!)

## v0.0.5
* Renamed the angular module to `siyfion.sfTypeahead`.
* Renamed the angular directive to `sfTypeahead`.
* Added two-way binding support to ng-model.

## v0.0.4
* Added one-way binding support to ng-model.
